Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
Both websites offer Git-based source code repository services. Whilst bitbucket focuses on private repositories and allows 5 free collaborators, Github is better suited overall for public repositories.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
Matthew Roberts

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
Jon Mountjoy

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
First commit was made by DavePearce.
Last commit was made by DavePearce.

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
No, neither project is still active. Judging by the commit descriptions, Project A likely failed due to bad code that was uneffecient and hard to read/work with. Project B seemed more organised, however the next release hasn't been prepared.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
For Project A, api.pi, and for Project B, pom.xml.

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
